# AudioVisual-Music-Video
This is a repository for my code files that I used to create an audiovisual music project using the song Empty - Martin Garrix and Dubvision. The video is put together in TouchDesigner where some instances interpret the data of the song to go along with the visuals. Some of the visuals include 3D object files to enchance the visual narrative.
